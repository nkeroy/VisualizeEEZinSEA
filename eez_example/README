To get the respective individual countries EEZ folders, visit:
  http://www.marineregions.org/gazetteer.php?p=search
  
  Important fields-
  1. Search [Country name]
  2. Place Type [find EEZ]
  
If search is successful, you should see a link e.g. 
  http://www.marineregions.org/gazetteer.php?p=details&id=8484
  (Vietnam Exclusive Economic Zone)
  
  At the bottom of the page, you should see a line in this format:
    [Download	Layer: MarineRegions:eez - format:]
    
    For the format, choose "Shapefile".
    Click "Download" and save the folder to your chosen location. 
    This is the EEZ folder you will need in order to generate the image.
    
    Rename this folder (my recommendation) such that it displays "[eez]_[country_name]" e.g "eez_thailand".
    Put this folder into eez_example, which you will need to download from this repository.
    
    In order to view the respective EEZ, you will need to change the directory value in "generateEEZ.R".
    The line that you will need to edit is this:
      eez <- readOGR(dsn = "./eez_vietnam/",...)
      
      * currently, the eez that the code is taking is in the eez_vietnam directory.
      * suppose you want to change to singapore eez 
        (assuming you have downloaded the folder from the links above and renamed it to "eez_singapore")
      * you will need to change the dsn to: 
        eez <- readOGR(dsn = "./eez_singapore/",...)
        
    Once the above steps have been completed, just run the code in R. 
    An index.html image should show in your browser.
